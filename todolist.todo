- shortcut : can take them even tho they aren't unlocked (to test)
- enable gimmick sound even before summer 19
- Start routing : fleet types allowed can change depending on parts (eg: summer 21 E2/E3)
- additional check doesn't work cause of JSON serialization/deszrialization
- ChNodeReplacedAfterUnlockRule doesn't work (fixed but need to be tested Fall 17 E4) (need to handle that properly in branching ?)
